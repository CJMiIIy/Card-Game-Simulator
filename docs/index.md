## How to Play

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.cgsYoutubeId %}

When navigating through CGS, you may find it useful to use [keyboard shortcuts](keyboard.html).

## How to Create and Share

You can mange your card games by tapping the center card game in the Main Menu:

You can then tap on the "Share" button to create a CGS Deep Link that you can send to other people, so that they can click on it and get access to that card game.
For example, the CGS Deep Link for [Arcmage](https://arcmage.org/) is: [https://cgs.link/arcmage](https://cgs.link/arcmage)

You can also tap the "Download" button to manually enter the CGS AutoUpdate URL for the game you would like to download.
For example, the CGS AutoUpdate URL for Arcmage is: https://www.cardgamesimulator.com/games/Arcmage/Arcmage.json
